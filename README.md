# BigNum
A class that will handle mathematical operations of massive numbers.

### Desired outcomes
* The goal of this project is to accurately do calculations on massive numbers without having to worry about method names  
* Support all operations with operator overloading

### Currently supported operations
* incrementing by 1 (++)
* adding an (int) to BigNum
* decrementing by 1 (--)
* cout
